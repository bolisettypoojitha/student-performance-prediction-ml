# Hybrid Machine Learning Approach for Student Performance Prediction

This project predicts student academic performance using machine learning techniques.
A hybrid approach integrating SMOTE and feature selection is proposed to handle class
imbalance and feature redundancy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
UCI Machine Learning Repository – Student Performance Dataset

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- F1-Score

## Results
The proposed hybrid approach improved performance on imbalanced data and achieved
better F1-scores compared to baseline models.
